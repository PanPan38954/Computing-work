Once upon a time, there was a helicopter called the mil v12. It used by the Ussr to transport nukes around the soviet union.
It has 2 rotors with 5 blades each and has 4 turboshaft engine. It can carry 200 passengers. One day....
The howling wind blew across the barren desert. The radial enines coughed under the extreme cold. A long line of trucks carried nukes
